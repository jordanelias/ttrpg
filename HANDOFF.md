# Handoff

Plain, hand-maintained continuity for Valoria. Update this when you pause mid-task; a
git commit *is* the session close. The SessionStart banner (`tools/session_status.py`)
surfaces the "Next actions" section below, alongside `git status` / last commit.

This replaces the old session-log + `canon/session_checkpoint.md` + checkpoint machinery
(which depended on the retired GitHub-API harness and token budgets).

## Pending

- _(nothing in flight)_

## Decisions

- 2026-06-28 — **Open-session unification + LB-22 closed.** Reviewed every `origin` session branch;
  six were already squash-merged into main (#14–#21), one (`claude/github-ci-environment-review` = PR #18)
  carried genuinely-unmerged work, and `claude/refresh-state-3m7nL` (abandoned 04-20 pre-migration line
  carrying the retired `session_checkpoint`/`session_log` harness) was excluded from the merge. Unified
  PR #18's **net-new** half (the LB-22 backlog) onto main — its already-landed half (12 skills +
  coverage_matrix, via #16) was kept at main's version, no re-litigation. **LB-22 done:** `valoria-orchestrator`
  retired to `deprecated/skills/`; `valoria-vector-audit` read-path rewritten; `ci_hooks_verifier.py`
  Check 4 flipped to **blocking for `skills/`** (`tools/` stays WARN pending the API→disk port). PR #18
  closed as superseded. `ci_register_size_check.py` taken from #18 (importable, no-PyYAML, ships the
  drift-guard test) with #22's `names_index.yaml` threshold line re-added; `lane_assignments.yaml`
  owns-globs repointed to `deprecated/`.
- 2026-06-28 — **Master Workplan v5** authored (`designs/audit/2026-06-28-recent-work-orchestration/`),
  reconciling the post-v4 work (06-12→06-28) into one register and superseding v4. Roadmap +
  lane_assignments repointed to v5. Ledger verified live: **713** entries / 0 duplicate IDs / ED 1042.
  (v5 de-staled this pass to live HEAD; PRs #16–#22 reconciled — see its §0/§10.)
- 2026-06-28 — **ED-912**: Disposition & Knot unified on a ±5 swing (Bonds ≥5 now a Knot
  prerequisite; break = Disposition −3 / 4 Composure). Resolves ED-841/842/912/914; supersedes
  PP-632/PP-684. Source-of-truth + consumer tail regenerated; "Stance table" rename in combat.
- 2026-06-26 — **J-31** social-contest docket recovered (ED-938/939/1042 + rule resolutions);
  22-doc cross-corpus reference + terminology repair landed (#13). contest.py sim edit deferred
  behind pre-existing sim-fabrication debt (19 uncited constants on main).
- 2026-06-24 — Migrated the Claude↔GitHub automation to a Claude Code-native model:
  retired the `/home/claude` GraphQL/cache/session harness; gates now live once in `tools/`
  and run in CI (authoritative) + local hooks/`.githooks` (advisory). See the migration PR.

## Next actions

_(Reserved-ID blocks are exhausted — ED ceiling 1042 past A/B/C 890–999. Re-block before any new ID
allocation: workplan-v5 **LB-21**, at the next integration pause.)_

- **Done this pass:** unified PR #18's net-new into main → **LB-22 complete** (orchestrator retired to
  `deprecated/skills/`; `valoria-vector-audit` read-path rewritten; `ci_hooks_verifier` Check 4 blocking
  for `skills/`). Earlier passes already landed the coverage_matrix single-source + 12-skill boilerplate
  strip (#16) — kept at main's version during the unify.
- **LB-22 residual (small):** `tools/` analysis utilities still carry `/home/claude` refs (WARN tier in
  `ci_hooks_verifier`); flip the `tools/` scope to blocking only after the GitHub-API→working-tree port
  (`freshness_gate`, `broken_dependency_checker`, `compliance_check`, `extract_*`, `valoria_collator`,
  `valoria_bulk_fix`). `valoria-orchestrator`'s old `tests/registry/test_descriptor_registry.py` import
  is dead (reads `/home/claude/…`, not CI-collected) — left as-is.
- **CI debt blocking-flips (LB-23):** after the **K-2 SHA-split** (115 `canonical_sha` fields out of
  `canonical_sources.yaml` → `references/canonical_freshness.yaml`), flip `freshness_gate`'s
  stale-canonical step back to blocking; flip `validate_ed_citations` (tool `sys.exit(1)`s but the CI job
  pins `continue-on-error: true` → non-blocking) once its count is triaged toward 0 — **now 315 violations
  / 190 open-ref info live** (was 748/788; #20's validator-precision pass dropped it). Solo / K-2 / LB-6.
- **`ci_political_v30` read-routing (LB-24):** raw file ~26k but tracked read returns 0 (index-routes).
- **Ledger-status reconciliation (LA-23, Lane A — mostly done):** flipped ED-841/842/912 `open`→`resolved`
  and filed the never-written ED-938/ED-939 (backfilled from #13; artifacts verified). Dropped the
  report-only `validate_ed_citations` count 748→731. **Residual:** ED-914 left `open` — its mechanical
  parts remain (PP-719 record-or-strike; dead `fieldwork_design_v1` parent-path refs in `params/bg/core.md`,
  `designs/scene/fieldwork_v30.md`, `designs/scene/fieldwork_godot.md`).
- **Design-tier docket awaiting Jordan:** J-31 extended (social-contest deliberative-game findings,
  row #39 → LA-19) and the new **J-36** (Key-bus closure for the 6 off-bus writers, row #40 — gated on
  the distillation report's deferred adversarial pass).

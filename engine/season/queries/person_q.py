"""`queries/person_q.py` -- the ASKER-FIRST Query family, `04_CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §A.1's AX-2
row and §A.2's table.

> `queries/`  ownerless functions: world_q (World first) · **person_q (asker first)** · cache
>
> `queries/person_q` | owns **nothing** | may read **a `PersonInterior` snapshot only** | -- | --

⚠ **ONE MEMBER, AND THE SMALLNESS IS A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN A STUB.** Unit L3 adjudicated every
candidate against `04` per symbol instead of executing `ED-IN-0206` item (2) literally, which would
have been wrong. That row reads *"§A.1's AX-2 row assigns the person-side family to
`queries/person_q`; step 7 put budget/opening_set/assemble/entrenchment in `decision.py` instead."*
Measured:

- **`budget` and `opening_set` are named BY `04:133` as `decision/`'s OWN members** -- *"`decision/`
  AX-2's island: questions · opening_set · choose · budget"*. Moving them here would BREAK
  conformance, not restore it. ED-IN-0206 item (2) is wrong about them and says so now.
- **`assemble` is the `questions` member**, same line.
- **`entrenchment` is the only one of the four `04` does not name**, and it is person-first in
  signature and self-declares as a person Query at its own first statement --
  `TRACE.query("entrenchment", "person")`. It reads a `Person` and three ints and touches nothing
  else, which is exactly the *"`PersonInterior` snapshot only"* the table allows. So it is here.
- **Every function in `world_q.py` takes `w: World` first** -- all thirteen, checked by `ast`. There
  is no misfiled person-first Query hiding in the world-side module.

⚠ **§A.3 ROW 2's PROPERTY IS THE POINT, NOT THE FILE COUNT.** *"one `Query` class holding both
families"* becomes *"two modules; the second cannot import the first"*, forced by T-f: *"in one
class, a person-side function calls a resolver-side one with no import to scan."* Splitting by
module makes that checkable, and **nothing checked it until this unit** --
`test_person_q_cannot_reach_the_world_side` is the scan.

`decision/` MAY import this module (`04 §C.3`: *"`decision/` imports `person_q` and `data/`"*), and
does: `choose` and `options` read `stance_toward` and `said_of` from here. The AX-2 by-path scan
(`test_decision_package_never_names_world_anywhere_under_it`) forbids `queries.world_q` and
`queries.cache` from `decision/` and admits `queries.person_q`; this module's own scan
(`test_person_q_cannot_reach_the_world_side`) still forbids `decision`, so the edge runs one way.

    ⚠ IT TAKES CLAIMS, NOT A WORLD, AND NOT A PERSON. `#353 :634` permits `sense()` exactly one
    World among the non-decision functions, and §F1 clause 4 runs person-side; handing this a
    World would make `belief_contradicts` read the world, which is the filter §F1 spends two
    paragraphs forbidding (*"a filter on world truth would be `choose` reading the world"*).

    THE MOST RECENT, THEN THE MOST CONFIDENT. A ledger may hold two claims about one
    `(subject, predicate)` -- that is what a ledger IS -- and answering with the first found would
    make the verdict depend on append order. No matching claim is UNKNOWN, never False: §F1's
    asymmetry is that absence of a belief is not a belief in the negative.

    AT DEPOSIT. `weigh(c) -> [0, 1]` is how far this holder credits one claim; the caller builds it
    (`decision/options.py::teller_weight`) because this module may not import `decision/`. With
    a `weigh`, the comparator ranks a claim by `(support, when, confidence)`, where `support` is
    the noisy-OR over the DISTINCT ORIGINS asserting the same value (below). `None` is today's

"""`seam/contest.py` -- `04_CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §A.2's `seam/contest` row: *"Dispatches;
enforces `max_depth`; returns Events + degree, or a typed refusal."*

`contest()` itself, the manifest-shaped provider lookup `contest_subsystem()`, the typed
`ContestError`, and `Resolution` -- what the seam returned as the fold sees it.

The degree side lives in `seam/ladder.py` and this module calls into it; the dependency is
one-directional by construction, because §A.2 gives the ladder its own row (*"nothing.
`degree(margin, veto?) -> Degree`"*) and a seam that graded its own result would be the second
resolver `S27.2` names as its highest-value refusal.

Moved whole from the flat `seam.py` by unit L2 of
`workplans/2026-09-09-layer1-conformance-plan.md`; `seam/` is a directory on §A.2's nine-module
list (`04:135`) and was shipped as a file at step 8 (ED-IN-0206).

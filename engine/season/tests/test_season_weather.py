"""v9 IN-21 -- FORCE-WEATHER: a keyed seasonal draw on MATTER's yield term (`H-26`).

The draw is `world_q.season_factor_of`, read at the yield step in `loop/matter.py`; its distribution is
the `season_factor_draw` fixture (one tuple of equally likely multipliers per season of the year,
`()` = off). Each test asks the real MATTER barrier, never a re-derivation of the arithmetic.

THE FALSIFIERS, each with the failure it would show:
  * CONTROL: with the draw off, `build_realm(0)`'s content hash is the pre-change reading at build, after
    one season and after two; and, on the one-town world, a declared all-1.0 table (the draw ON but
    degenerate) reads the same as no table over two seasons -- a draw that perturbed the arithmetic
    when it multiplies by 1.0 would move it;
  * DROUGHT: a drought-only table leaves the larder below the control arm's after the same barriers,
    and the control arm emits no `shortfall:` observation where the drought arm does;
  * KEYED: the same seed twice gives one hash; a different seed reads a different factor sequence; the
    factor at a tick is the table's entry at `tick % len(table)` (the season of the year, read off the
    clock and stored nowhere).

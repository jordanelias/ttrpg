# Handoff — SC (Social Contest)

Lane-scoped continuity for the `SC` (social contest) lane, per the `ED-<LANE>-NNNN` namespace
(`ED-IN-0001`) and `CLAUDE.md` §3's session-lane-scoping convention. Root `HANDOFF.md` is the
index; see it for cross-lane/global items.

## Pending

- **Social-contest staged rebuild (`claude/happy-shaw-da0f1d`, IN PROGRESS).** Agonist/antagonist gated rebuild
  of the contest engine: promote the stranded 62-test groundup engine (`designs/audit/2026-06-03-contest-groundup/`,
  actually **9 modules / 151 tests green**) onto the v30 surface + fold in CR1–CR7, build all four deliberative
  games (Agôn/Negotiation/Inquiry/Consensus), close J-36 seams, drive to settled canon (T-25 + sim-validation).
  Plan: `C:\Users\Jordan\.claude\plans\this-is-a-broader-nested-mountain.md`. Runs stage-by-stage via the Workflow
  tool (Opus agonist/antagonist/judge + Haiku scribe), Jordan ratifies each gate; cadence = auto-advance, interrupt
  only for design-authority forks.
  - **Stage 0 (Foundation) DONE + Gate 0 RATIFIED (2026-06-30).** Reconciliation contract + decisions:
    `designs/audit/2026-06-30-contest-stage0-reconciliation/DECISIONS.md` (+ raw map + gate packet). Three ratified
    forks: **D0-1** appeal ethos/pathos/logos = build both multiplicative+additive behind a flag, decide by seeded
    A/B (player-win-rate vs venue-identity-spread); **D0-2** σ-leverage → new numpy-free `sim/autoload/sigma_leverage.py`
    sibling (retires the test-dir/numpy/sys.path-hack + the two-σ-kernels debt); **D0-3** TN6/7/8 divergence + Jordan's
    fractional-Ob idea → contest stays δσ TN7 (unaffected), open a substrate probe (reopens CR6 uniformity), non-blocking.
    Good news: `faction.py` already has BG-Vote/Succession/committee-band → Consensus mostly promote-existing.
    IDs reserved: `contest_rebuild` = ED 1055-1079 / PP 800-809.
  - **Stage 1a DONE + committed (d64e2ffe).** `sim/autoload/sigma_leverage.py` — numpy-free σ sibling, byte-identical
    to the oracle, 623 tests green; two-σ-kernels debt retired.
  - **Stage 1b DONE + committed.** 9-module kernel promoted to `sim/personal/contest/`, rewired onto the σ sibling
    (no third kernel); `degree` = clean carry-across (pool-aware integer degree added to sigma_leverage, distinct from
    `dice_engine.Degree` combat enum); old stub → `contest_legacy_stub.py`; 815 sim tests + both importers green.
  - **D0-3 RESOLVED → HYBRID** (present-as-Ob display over the δσ substrate; CR6 upheld, not reopened). Memo:
    `designs/audit/2026-06-30-contest-fractional-ob-probe/MEMO.md`; decision → ED-1055. Probe also surfaced a LIVE
    combat bug (`dice_engine.roll_pool` ignores `tn`; TN5/6/8 weapons rolled at TN7 rate) → spun out as a
    combat-lane task (`task_210994b7`, out of contest scope — see `handoffs/HANDOFF_PC.md`).
  - **Stage 1c DONE + merged into main (PR #44, all CI green).** v30 re-skin (8 proceedings, Persuasion Track
    banding, 4 adjudicator types) + `build_contest`/`resolve_contest` wrapper + MECHANICS registry, mirroring
    `tests/sim/mass_battle/engine.py`. 888 tests green.
  - **Stage 1d / Gate A DONE — 3 forks ratified by Jordan (2026-07-01).** Propagated CR1 (wrapper, confirmed
    already-realized)/CR2 (σ-substrate, confirmed already-realized)/CR3 (three trackers: Concentration+Face+
    Persuasion, Composure retired — contest-scope only) into prose (`social_contest_v30.md` §4/§8 + co-files,
    `params/contest.md`) + code (`sim/personal/contest/` Face primitive) + ledger (ED-1055, ED-1056). Packet:
    `designs/audit/2026-07-01-contest-gate-a-packet/GATE_A_packet.md`. **Ratified:** (1) Face scale-binding =
    combo formula, not a straight rescale — `Face_max = Charisma×3` (ceiling, player-build-controlled) +
    `Face_current = round(Standing/10 × Face_max)` (position within ceiling, earned through play, Standing's
    kernel math/Readiness/leak feed untouched); (2) Composure retirement scoped to the contest tracker only
    (knots/combat/conviction untouched, confirmed); (3) provisional EDs use non-basis citation phrasing until
    ratified (standing policy). A small Sonnet-tier finalize pass is applying the resolved formula + 4 agreed
    nits (dead imports, ED-1056 recitation, prose wording, TRACKERS sourcing); that pass also caught the ratified
    Face formula shipped with zero test coverage and added 10 targeted kernel checks (boundary cases, midpoint
    round-half-to-even, non-mutation, live-tracking). **Committed (884cf89a).** 1041 sim+valoria + 244 kernel
    checks green. Push to `claude/happy-shaw-da0f1d` updates the open tracking PR ([ttrpg#44]) — Jordan merges,
    not this session.
  - **NEW standing requirement (decision 5, 2026-07-01): the player-interaction model is a concrete deliverable,
    not a late audit.** First-draft walkthrough seeded ahead of Stage 6 so every later stage designs toward it:
    `designs/audit/2026-07-01-contest-player-interaction/player_interaction_walkthrough_v1.md` — setup screen,
    the exchange loop (Appraise / style-choice cards / roll-and-resolve / Face+Concentration bars), the
    resolution screen, and how Negotiation/Inquiry/Consensus should each look different from Agôn's track meter
    so Stage 4 doesn't converge them onto one UI. Stage 2 now owns authoring the Style/Venue flavor text; Stage 3
    now owns the Appraise-reveal boundary for `armature_position`; Stage 4 now owns each game's interaction
    shape; Stage 6 finalizes+ratifies the model this seeds. Plan file amended accordingly.
  - **Gate A committed (`884cf89a` mechanics + `98ecdf41` player-model), PR #44 all-green.**
  - **Stage 2 / Gate B (dictionaries) DONE + committed.** Built Venue×8 / Adjudicator×4 / Style×4 /
    InteractionType×4 typed dicts (`sim/personal/contest/dictionaries.py`, new module) + Style/Venue
    flavor text; closed ED-137 (Panel adjudicator). Packet:
    `designs/audit/2026-07-01-contest-gate-b-packet/` (pre-ratification snapshot + the authoritative
    `GATE_B_closeout_audit.md`). **Ratified and independently re-verified in actual code (not just ledger
    text):** Panel votes weighted-by-standing (ED-1057; reuses the existing `Adjudicator.discipline` field,
    NOT the contestant `Standing` name — no new state invented); Panel reachability = rebind Guild
    Arbitration's adjudicator → Panel (ED-1059; NO appeals — "let the decision ride"; roster stays 8);
    Terminal Doubt = terminal-value-everywhere, banded (PersuasionTrack) + tally (TallyAtClose) branches
    both specified (ED-1060); Guilds "GM picks" boost = context-derived from the venue's dominant
    ethos/pathos/logos via the existing `Appeal` machinery (ED-1061; literal "GM picks" text removed from
    both prose heads). ED-1055/1056/1058 flipped to `status: ratified` (a bookkeeping fix — they were left
    `provisional` only because two earlier finalize-workflow attempts were killed by infrastructure
    issues — API 401/529 errors and a background-task stop, unrelated to the work itself — before
    flipping their own metadata; the ratifications themselves happened earlier via Jordan's answers).
    1041 sim+valoria + 319 kernel tests green; freshness gate clean (5/5 fresh); no scope drift (grep
    confirmed knots/combat/conviction untouched, Composure retirement still contest-scoped).
  - **SOURCE-RESEARCH GROUNDING (found 2026-07-01 via files13.zip → already in repo, NOT orphaned).** The
    deliberation-critique source research
    `designs/audit/2026-06-28-social-contest-deliberation-critique/source-research/` (a 3-part
    Renaissance-deliberation / machination-games-lens / model-testing trilogy) is READ-AND-CITED-BUT-NOT-APPLIED:
    it shaped the plan's four-games / alea / consensus / commitment-store / armature *shape* via `critique.md`,
    but its rich detail (Dowlen small-pool weighted lottery; `liberum veto` as self-undermining equilibrium;
    Padgett robust action; Putnam two-level bargaining) is not yet in the code. Plan amended: Stage 3 (armature)
    and Stage 4 (four games) agonists must now READ the source-research trilogy directly, not just the critique
    distillation, so this commissioned scholarship actually reaches the implementation.
  - **NEXT: Stage 3** (rhetoric grounding + adjudicator armature — CR4 stasis, CR5 self-gating, the
    Style×Conviction dot-product aimed at the judge — reading the source-research trilogy per above,
    not just the critique distillation).

## Decisions

- 2026-06-26 — **J-31** social-contest docket recovered (ED-938/939/1042 + rule resolutions);
  22-doc cross-corpus reference + terminology repair landed (#13). `contest.py` sim edit deferred
  behind pre-existing sim-fabrication debt (19 uncited constants on `main`).

## Next actions

- **Design-tier docket awaiting Jordan:** J-31 extended (social-contest deliberative-game findings,
  row #39 → LA-19, `designs/workplans/valoria_master_workplan_v5.md`).
- **`contest.py` fabrication-debt triage** — 19 uncited constants block the J-31 terminology
  propagation into code (also tracked at `decision_queue.md` item 16).
- **contest_rebuild Stage 1+ gates** — each stage ratified individually (Gate 0 ratified
  2026-06-30; ED 1055-1079 / PP 800-809 reserved; also tracked at `decision_queue.md` item 15).

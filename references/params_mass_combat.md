## Battle Plan Templates (PP-235)
Phase 1: select one battle plan covering all units. Individual unit orders derived from plan. General may override one unit per turn with a Command check (TN 7, Ob 1; failure = unit follows plan).

| Plan | All Units Do |
|------|-------------|
| Advance | Engage nearest enemy; Aggressive formation |
| Hold | Defend position; Defensive formation |
| Pincer | 2 units engage front, 1 flanks |
| Withdraw | Orderly retreat; rear unit covers |
| Screen | Ranged units fire; melee holds line |

## BATTLE TURN PHASE STRUCTURE (7 phases, revised 2026-04-02)

| Phase | Name | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Strategy Declaration | Formations, tactics declared (simultaneous, secret). Thread intent declared at Phase 4 start, not Phase 1. (PP-235) |
| 2 | Volley | Projectile fire. Damage recorded, not applied. TN 6 [PROVISIONAL]. |
| 3 | Manoeuvre | Movement by speed. Reserve commitments. |
| 4 | Offensive Thread | Dissolution, Pulling, Locking. Practitioner-only. Skipped if no practitioner present. BG: always skipped. |
| 5 | Engagement | Pool split, roll, damage recorded. Max 3 simultaneous (TTRPG). |
| 6 | Cascade | Step 1: ALL damage applied simultaneously (Volley+Thread+Engagement). Step 2: Discipline checks. Step 3: Morale checks. Step 4: General action (Rally/Support Thread/Personal combat). Step 5: Support Thread Leap resolves. |
| 7 | Reform | Discipline restore, Morale +1, sub-unit merge for non-engaged units. |


## Phase Consolidation — 5-Phase Structure (PP-235)
For reduced cognitive load, the 7-phase structure may be run as 5 phases:

| Phase | Combines | Content |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Strategy Declaration | Battle plan selection + overrides |
| 2 | Ranged + Movement | Volley fires, then movement resolves (old Phases 2+3) |
| 3 | Thread | Offensive Thread operations (old Phase 4). Declared here, not Phase 1. |
| 4 | Engagement + Cascade | Pool split, roll, ALL damage applied (Volley+Thread+Engagement). Discipline/Morale checks. Rally/Support. (old Phases 5+6) |
| 5 | Reform | Discipline restore, Morale +1, sub-unit merge (old Phase 7) |

Damage simultaneity preserved: all sources resolve together at Phase 4 end. The 7-phase structure remains available as the full-detail reference.

Damage simultaneity: Effective Power for Phase 5 calculated from Size as of Phase 3 end. Phase 4 Thread effects do not reduce Size before Phase 5 — all applied together at Phase 6 Step 1.
> **Lock phase assignment in mass combat (PP-191):** [PROVISIONAL] Offensive Lock (targeting enemy formation) = Phase 4; declared at Phase 1 as "offensive." Support Lock (stabilising own formation) = Phase 6 Step 5; declared at Phase 1 as "support." If undeclared: defaults to Phase 6. A practitioner may not perform both Offensive and Support Lock in the same battle turn.


## Core Formula (PP-233)

### Definitions
| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Effective Size contribution to pool | min(Size, Command) |
| Effective Discipline contribution to Health | min(Discipline, Command) |
| Health per Size (H) | min(Discipline, Command) + DR |
| Total Health | Size × H |
| Pool | min(Size, Command) + Command |
| Damage per success | 1 + Power |
| Damage dealt | successes × (1 + Power) |
| Size after round | ⌊ remaining Health ÷ H ⌋ |
| Destroyed | Size = 0 |

### Key rules
- **Command caps both Size and Discipline contributions** — to pool and to Health respectively. Full Size still counts for total Health.
- **Pool = min(Size, Command) + Command.** A Size 2 Command 5 unit rolls 7D. Size loss only reduces the pool when Size > Command.
- **Damage is simultaneous.** Both sides deal and receive damage before Size is recalculated. A unit destroyed this round still delivers its outgoing damage.
- **H is fixed for the unit** (Discipline and DR don't change mid-battle). Current Size = ⌊ remaining Health ÷ H ⌋.

### Worked example
**Group 1:** Size 5, Command 5, Discipline 5, Power 3 (Heavy Infantry), DR 2
- Pool = min(5,5)+5 = 10D
- H = min(5,5)+2 = 7
- Total Health = 5×7 = 35
- Damage/success = 1+3 = 4

**Group 2:** Size 6, Command 3, Discipline 3, Power 1 (Light Infantry), DR 0
- Pool = min(6,3)+3 = 6D  ← Size capped at Command
- H = min(3,3)+0 = 3
- Total Health = 6×3 = 18  ← full Size used
- Damage/success = 1+1 = 2

**Round (4 successes G1, 5 successes G2 — simultaneous):**
| | Group 1 | Group 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Damage dealt | 4×4 = 16 | 5×2 = 10 |
| Incoming | 10 | 16 |
| Health after | 25 | 2 |
| Size after | ⌊25÷7⌋ = **3** | ⌊2÷3⌋ = **0 — destroyed** |

Group 2 is destroyed but their 10 damage resolves first (simultaneous). Group 1 drops Size 5→3.

## Unit Stats (1–7 unless noted)
| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Size | Headcount/health pool. At 0: destroyed. |
| Power | Dice pool ceiling. Derived from Size. |
| Discipline | Organisational integrity (1–7). |
| Morale | Rout threshold (1–7). |
| Speed | Slow / Standard / Fast |
| Weapon Type | Inherits personal combat table [COMPILED] |
| Armour Tier | Inherits personal combat DR table [COMPILED] |

## Power Tier Reference [PROPOSAL]
| Power | Tier |
|----|------|
| 1 | Levy |
| 2 | Militia |
| 3 | Professional |
| 4 | Veteran |
| 5 | Elite |
| 6–7 | Exceptional/Peerless |

## Faction Military → Unit Quality [PROPOSAL]
| Military | Max Power | Starting Discipline ceiling |
|----------|--------|--------------------------|
| 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 4 |
| 4 | 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 5 | 6 |
| 6 | 6 | 7 |
| 7 | 7 | 7 |

## Command [PROPOSAL] (PP-232)
Command = ⌈(Charisma + Cognition) ÷ 2⌉
Governs: sub-unit limit (max = Command; TTRPG hard cap 3); Discipline ceiling; Morale floor (= 1 while general present); tactic execution (Command dice vs Ob).
Command = 1: cannot restore Discipline to any unit — all degradation permanent for that battle.

## Battle Phases (TTRPG) — SUPERSEDED
See §BATTLE TURN PHASE STRUCTURE above (7 phases, ED-050 Option D). The prior 5-phase structure is obsolete.

## Discipline Degradation (Deterministic) [PROPOSAL] (PP-232)
Fires at Phase 6 Cascade: Size lost BY THE ATTACKING UNIT this turn > defending unit Discipline -> defending Discipline -1. Symmetric mutual losses do NOT trigger degradation for either defender. (PP-259/ED-140)
| Discipline | Power penalty |
|----------|-----------|
| 5–7 | None |
| 3–4 | −1D |
| 1–2 | −2D |
| 0 | Formation broken; cannot attack; Reform or rout |

Restoration: Reform Phase only (not engaged), +1 Discipline, Command ≥ current Discipline + 1.

## Morale Degradation Triggers [PROPOSAL]
| Trigger | Change |
|---------|--------|
| Size < 50% max | −1 |
| Size < 25% max | −1 additional |
| Discipline broken this turn | −1 |
| Allied unit routed in same zone | −1 |
| General incapacitated | −1 |
| General killed | −2 (not subject to phase cap) |
| Flanked and lost exchange | −1 |
| Idle 2+ consecutive turns | −1 |

Cap: −3 per Cascade Phase (general death separate and uncapped).
Floor: 1 while general present. At 0: rout.
Rout contagion: −1 Morale to adjacent units; secondary loss cannot cascade to rout until next turn.

## DR Table — Mass Combat (PP-104: Projectile split into 4 categories)

### Melee weapons
| Armour | LC | HC | LB | HB |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| None | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Light | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| Medium | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 |
| Heavy | 6 | 5 | 3 | 1 | 6 |

Weapon Effectiveness:
| Attacker | vs None | vs Light | vs Medium | vs Heavy |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| LightCut | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| HeavyCut | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| LightBlunt | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| HeavyBlunt | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ |

### Projectile weapons (mass combat only — PP-104)
| Armour | LP (arrows) | HP (bolts) | LBl (sling) | HBl (siege) |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| None | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Light | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| Medium | 4 | 3 | 4 | 1 |
| Heavy | 7 | 5 | 6 | 2 |

LP = Light Pierce (arrows). HP = Heavy Pierce (bolts). LBl = Light Blunt (sling). HBl = Heavy Blunt Siege.
*[PP-196 — confirmed: LP/HP vs None=0 is correct (net hits only, no DR reduction needed); LBl vs Light=2 reflects blunt trauma advantage vs light armour]*

### Weapon Effectiveness (combined)
| Attacker | vs None | vs Light | vs Medium | vs Heavy |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| LightCut | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| HeavyCut | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| LightBlunt | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| HeavyBlunt | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ |
| Bow (LP) | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| HP (bolts) | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Sling clay | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Sling rock | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Sling metal | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Sling lead | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✗ |
| HBl (siege) | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ |

HeavyBlunt and HBl are the only classes effective vs Heavy armour.

**Artillery sight-line rule (PP-106):** HBl units require clear line of sight to target.
A unit in Line formation between Artillery and target blocks the shot (target is in the
firing unit's dead zone). Artillery must target units with unobstructed paths — typically
units in the same zone or flanking positions. This creates the primary counter to Artillery:
block sight-lines with front-line formations; flank to reach Artillery directly.

## Battle Scale [PROPOSAL]
| Scale | 1 Size ≈ | Thread Thread Sensitivity minimum |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Skirmish | ~10 soldiers | 30+ |
| Company | ~100 soldiers | 30+ |
| Battle | ~500 soldiers | 50+ |
| Campaign | ~1,000 soldiers | 50+ |
| War | ~5,000 soldiers | 70+ |


## Mass Battle RS Multiplier (PP-192, PP-225) [PROVISIONAL]
All RS costs AND gains from Thread operations in mass battle ×3 (PP-225). Applied after degree table resolution. Coherence costs NOT multiplied. RS ceiling (100) and seasonal cap (±10) still apply.
| Op | Normal RS (Success) | Mass Battle RS (×3) |
|----|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Pulling (failure) | −2 | −6 |
| Locking (success) | −1 | −3 |
| Dissolution (success) | −5 | −15 |
| Dissolution (failure) | −8 | −24 |
| Mending (success) | +1 | +3 |
| Mending (overwhelming) | +2 | +6 |
| Weaving Overwhelming (Relational+) | +1 | +3 |
Source: ST-TW-03 design note + PP-225 (gains also ×3).

## Thread Integration [COMPILED — stage11]

> **Mass battle Dissolution — campaign impact warning (PP-201):** [PROVISIONAL] Dissolution at mass battle scale is a **campaign-altering decision**, not a tactical one. E[RS per Dissolution attempt] = −18.4 at TS 70 (9D Spirit+History, Ob5). Three Dissolution attempts in a single battle produce E[RS after] ≈ 6 (Critical band) from a campaign-starting RS 60. A single Dissolution Failure when RS < 24 triggers the Rupture immediately. **Before a practitioner declares offensive Dissolution in mass battle:** the GM should confirm the table understands this is a world-stakes action. Dissolution in mass battle is the Einhir scale of operation. It may win a battle while ending a campaign. Weaving and Mending are the only RS-neutral or RS-positive mass battle Thread operations on average. Lock and Pull are risky (E −3 to −6 RS per attempt). Dissolution is in a category of its own.


> **RS<24 mass battle Rupture threshold (PP-204):** [PROVISIONAL] If RS is below 24 when a mass battle Thread operation is declared, the GM must inform the declaring practitioner before the roll: a Dissolution Failure at this RS level triggers the Rupture immediately (Dissolution Failure = −24 RS via ×3 multiplier; RS floor = 0 = Rupture). This is not a mechanic restriction — the practitioner may still attempt the operation. It is mandatory table information. At RS 0–23: any mass battle Dissolution Failure ends the campaign in the Rupture. Partial and worse results on Dissolution (−18 RS and −24 RS respectively) also carry Rupture risk at RS < 18 and RS < 25 respectively. Print this threshold on the mass battle Thread tracking sheet.

Combat Thread ops (Dissolution, offensive Pulling): Phase 2. Support ops (Weave, Mend, Lock, non-offensive Pulling): Phase 5. Both declared Phase 1.
Mass → Personal: Personal Action available at Phase 5 (Priority 8). Limit: 1 exchange/battle turn. General's Phase 5 consumed by personal combat (Command suspended).


## Single Operation Per Battle Turn — Mass Scale (PP-235)
In mass combat, a practitioner gets exactly 1 Thread operation per battle turn. No multi-round contact window at mass battle scale. Focus determines Leap success probability but does not extend the contact window at mass scale.

Rationale: mass battle turns represent longer timeframes. A single operation at mass scale represents sustained effort across the engagement phase. Full contact-window mechanics apply at personal scale only.


## Command Suspension During Thread Contact (PP-235)
While a practitioner-general is in Thread contact (Phase 4), their Command bonus is suspended. Sub-units follow automation:
1. Engage nearest enemy unit in same zone
2. If no enemy in zone: hold position
3. Default pool split: 50/50 (round Offence down)
4. Defensive formation if Size < 50%

Extends PP-111 (Command suspension during personal combat). Thematic: suspended rendering = cannot command.

## Key Design Axiom
Generalship dominates. Command asymmetry is intentional. Command=7 vs Command=1 general: near-certain outcome before dice rolled.


## RESOLVED PARAMS GAPS (PP-104, 2026-04-02)

### Pool Split — Phase 5 Engagement (PARAMS-GAP-04 resolved)
Declared in Phase 1. Any allocation valid, min 1D each side.
Default: ½ pool to Offence (round down), remainder Defence. [PROVISIONAL]

### Damage Formula — unit Strength loss (PARAMS-GAP-05 resolved)
Size loss = max(0, net hits + Dmg Mod − DR)
Dmg Mod from unit table below. *[PP-194 — confirmed]*

| Unit | Weapon | Dmg Mod |
|------|--------|---------|
| Levy | LightCut | +1 |
| Light Infantry | LightCut | +2 |
| Heavy Infantry | HeavyCut | +4 |
| Cavalry | HeavyCut | +5 |
| Piercing — Archer | Piercing/Bow | +0 |
| Piercing — Crossbow | Piercing/Crossbow | +0 base (+1 vs med+heavy post-DR) |
| Blunt — Throwing | Blunt/Throw | +1 |
| Blunt — Sling | Blunt/Sling | clay+0 / rock+1 / metal+2 / lead+3 vs med+heavy (−2D pool) |
| Artillery | HBl | +3 |
| Knights Templar | HeavyBlunt | +5 |


## Ranged DR Table (Volley Phase) — PP-188
Scaled (÷2 rounded up) from personal combat DR. Crossbow post-DR bonus applied after.
| Armour | vs Piercing | vs Blunt |
|--------|------------|---------|
| None | 0 | 0 |
| Light | 1 | 1 |
| Medium | 2 | 1 |
| Heavy | 3 | 2 |

Crossbow post-DR bonus (if net hits > 0): +1 vs Medium and Heavy. Scaled ÷2 from personal +2 (PP-189).
Sling: effective CP −2D; ammo modifier per unit table above.

HBl (Artillery/siege): uses PP-091 Bombard (flat Size damage). Not subject to Volley DR formula. Artillery is a separate unit type from HBl lead-sling infantry units.

Bow/LP (archer) unit effectiveness at CP4 (Veteran): vs None=1.6, vs Light=0, vs Med=0, vs Heavy=0. [PP-189: Dmg Mod +0; net successes only vs unarmoured. Re-sim pending.]
Crossbow/HP unit effectiveness at CP4: vs None=1.6, vs Light=0.6, vs Med=0.6, vs Heavy=0. [PP-189: post-DR +1 vs med+heavy; re-sim pending.]
HBl (lead sling) unit effectiveness at CP4: vs None=1.6, vs Light=1.6, vs Med=0.6, vs Heavy=0.6.
LBl remains anti-levy at mass scale (same DR as LP after scaling).

### BG Battle Partial outcome (PARAMS-GAP-06-MC resolved)
Margin = |attacker net − defender net|.
- Margin ≥ 2, attacker higher → Win: territory captured, Defender Military −1
- Margin ≤ 1 (either direction) → Partial: no territory change, Attacker Stability −1
- Margin ≥ 2, defender higher → Lose: no territory change, Attacker Military −1
[PROVISIONAL — ED-063: confirm Partial threshold and Stability cost]


<!-- patches: PP-173 (ranged DR split, HBl personal reference), PP-175 (mass combat DR scaled ÷2 provisional) -->


## SIM-X-22 Provisional Patches (PP-222, PP-224, PP-227, PP-229, PP-231)

### PP-222: Offensive Lock Blocks Cohesion Degradation [PROVISIONAL]
Offensive Lock (Phase 4) on a formation thread blocks Discipline degradation checks on the locked unit for the lock duration. The formation is frozen — it cannot degrade organisationally while the thread configuration holds it in place. ED-122 pending confirmation.

### PP-224: Diagnosis+Leap Collapse in Mass Battle [PROVISIONAL]
In mass battle, Diagnosis and Leap collapse to a single Phase 4 action (not 2 separate rounds). The PP-190 2-round rule (Diagnosis Round N, Leap Round N+1) applies to personal combat only. Mass battle tempo requires single-phase resolution. ED-124 pending confirmation.

### PP-227: Paradox Window — No Unit Stat Effect During Battle [PROVISIONAL]
A paradox window (P-22) has no mechanical effect on unit stats during the active battle turn. Pre-displacement values are used for all Phase 5 calculations. Displaced values apply on window auto-resolution at end of battle turn (Phase 7 Reform or later). ED-121 pending confirmation.

### PP-229: Contact Window Suspended During Zoom In [PROVISIONAL]
When a General triggers Zoom In (personal exchange during Phase 6 Step 4), any active Thread contact window is suspended — not consumed. Contact rounds do not tick during the personal exchange sub-scene. On return to mass scale, remaining contact rounds resume.

### PP-231: Cohesion Degradation = Asymmetry Mechanic [PROVISIONAL]
Discipline degradation is an asymmetry mechanic, not an attrition mechanic. It triggers only when: (a) Power asymmetry exists (stronger unit overwhelms weaker), (b) Thread-assisted Size loss creates sudden imbalance, or (c) Artillery bombardment. Symmetric engagements between equal-Power units do not trigger Discipline degradation — they produce attrition (Size loss) only. GM guidance note.

<!-- patch_history: references/params_mass_combat_history.md -->
<!-- canonical_sources: references/canonical_sources.yaml -->
## LBl (Sling) — Prepared Defence Exception (ED-065 resolved — provisional)
LBl (sling) attacks ignore the Prepared Defence bonus (+0 DR from Prepared Defence when targeted by LBl). Sling stones are concussive/indirect and bypass shield-angling. LP, HP, HBl: Prepared Defence applies normally. [PROVISIONAL]

## Artillery Morale Cascade Cap (ED-066 resolved — provisional)
The −3 Morale cap per Cascade Phase applies as a total across all non-general sources. Multiple simultaneous HBl artillery impacts count together toward the −3 cap, not separately. Example: 3 Artillery units each destroy a unit → triggers 3× −1 Morale → capped at −3 total, not −3 each. [PROVISIONAL]

## Commander Bonus Formulas — Consolidated (ED-033 resolved — provisional)
| Context | Formula | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| TTRPG mass combat | Command = ⌈(Charisma + Cognition) ÷ 2⌉ | Per params_mass_combat (PP-232) |
| BG battle resolution | Commander bonus = faction Military ÷ 3, round down (max +2D) | Per §B.3 |
| Hybrid Zoom In | Use TTRPG CR for TTRPG-layer actions; BG commander bonus for BG-layer accounting | No conversion between them |
[PROVISIONAL]

## Volley TN (ED-037 resolved — provisional)
Volley phase uses TN 6 (not TN 7). Rationale: ranged advantage before armour engagement; represents favourable conditions (distance, preparation). [PROVISIONAL — confirmed from prior provisional]
## Commander Bonus (PP-190)
Formula: faction Military ÷ 3, round down. Min 0, max +2D. Applies to BG mode. TTRPG uses Command = ⌈(Cha+Cog)÷2⌉ (PP-232). See consolidated table above.
## Altonian Invasion Units (PP-193, ED-036 resolved 2026-04-03)
Generated from Altonian Military ~5 (foreign professional standing army; above Crown/Church 4).
[ED-036 resolved 2026-04-03] Stats confirmed: Vanguard Str5 CP4 Coh4 Mor5 HeavyCut Medium. Elite Guard Str4 CP5 Coh5 Mor5 HeavyCut Heavy. Thread Corps Str3 CP3 Coh4 Mor4 TS40.

| Unit Type | Size | Power | Discipline | Morale | Armour | Weapon | Dmg Mod |
|-----------|----------|----|----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Altonian Heavy Infantry | 4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | Heavy | HeavyCut | +4 |
| Altonian Cavalry | 3 | 4 | 4 | 6 | Medium | HeavyCut | +5 |
| Altonian Crossbow | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | Light | HP | +0/+2 vs med+heavy |
| Altonian Artillery | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | None | HBl | +3 |

Commander bonus: Military 5 → +1D (5÷3=1, round down).
Deployment trigger: Institutional Pressure ≥ 75 (CLOCK-EDIT-01).
## LBl vs LP Dominance (PP-197 — ED-065 resolved)
LBl (sling) outperforms LP (arrows) only vs Light armour (+2 vs +1). LP equals or exceeds LBl at Medium and Heavy. Distinction is intentional: slings = anti-light-infantry; bows = anti-armoured. No change needed.
## BG Thread Operations (PP-200 — ED-080)
BG mode: Thread operations (Phase 4 Offensive, Phase 6 Support) are always skipped. No Coherence cost applies in BG — Thread ops do not occur at board scale. This is intentional (P-01: Thread operates below BG abstraction layer). Resolves ED-080.
## Planning Phase Time (PP-202 — ED-083)
Finding from bg_v05 simulation: Phase 1 planning ~8 min/player with reference cards; ~12-15 min without. Recommendation: pre-assign Seasonal Priority order on faction reference cards to reduce deliberation. No mechanical change required.

## HP (Crossbow) Reload — Mass Combat Scale (ED-094 resolved 2026-04-03)
HP crossbow units fire every Volley Phase at mass combat scale.
Individual reload cycle is abstracted — units stagger reloads historically.
Individual reload applies only in personal combat.

## Faction Tactic Cards — Confirmed (ED-019 resolved 2026-04-03)
2 unique tactic cards per faction. Confirmed:

**Crown:**
- Royal Authority: all Crown units +1 Martial this battle.
- Diplomatic Shield: no Stability loss from Partial outcome this season.

**Church:**
- Templar Vanguard: Knights Templar units +2 Discipline this battle.
- Excommunication Threat: opposing faction −1D all Domain Actions next season if Church Mandate ≥ 4.

**Remaining factions (Varfell, Hafenmark, Löwenritter, Revolution):** TBD — pending editorial design.

## PP-240 — Mutual total destruction
All units both sides to 0 simultaneously: draw. No territory change. Both factions Stability check Ob 1 at Accounting.

## PP-241 — Reform condition
Reform requires: Command ≥ current Discipline + 1 AND Command ≥ 2. Command=1 generals cannot reform any unit regardless of Discipline value.

## PP-245 — TTRPG Dmg Mod (resolves SIM-DEBT-05)
TTRPG Dmg Mod = ⌈BG Dmg Mod ÷ 2⌉.
| Unit | TTRPG Dmg Mod |
|------|--------------|
| Levy | +1 |
| Light Infantry | +1 |
| Heavy Infantry | +2 |
| Cavalry | +3 |
| Archer/Crossbow | +0 (+1 vs med/heavy post-DR for crossbow) |
| Sling | by ammo (−2D) |
| Artillery | +2 |
| Knights Templar | +3 |

## PP-249 — Coherence → Command: no penalty
Dissonance impairs Thread operations only. No Coherence penalty on Command tactic rolls.

## PP-250 — Zoom In mid-Phase-5 deferral fix
Mid-phase Zoom In fires at next legal phase-lock point. Phase-5 trigger → After Phase 6 Step 1 (not end-of-Phase-5).

## PP-256 — Feigned Retreat Discipline check Ob
Pursuing-side Discipline check = Ob 1. P(hold | Discipline 4) ≈ 87%. P(hold | Discipline 1) ≈ 40%.

## ED-167 provisional — CF wound on Zoom Out
CF wound during Zoom In → +1 Ob to that commander's BG tactic rolls for remainder of current battle.

## ED-170 provisional — Coherence recovery in multi-day battle
1 Coherence/night of rest (no Thread ops). Single-day battle: no in-battle Coherence recovery.

## HP Unit Volley-Reload Penalty (PP-260, ED-097)
HP (heavy projectile) unit that fires in Phase 2 (Volley): -2D to Phase 5 pool.
HP unit that did not fire in Phase 2: full pool in Phase 5.
LP (light projectile) units: no reload penalty at mass scale.
